### Hello!

We are excited to see what you can do.

To get a better idea of your design and implementation skills we would like you to work on improving the design of one of our open source projects. 

## Introduction

The project is called **Points**, you can learn more about it at https://github.com/fastruby/points/tree/designer-challenge if you are interested (but it's not required for this challenge).

This is a screenshot of the page you'll be working on:

![Points "projects" page screenshot](images/points-screenshot.png?raw=true)

## Task

We would like you to make some design changes to the `/projects` page (the screenshot above). Currently, the page has some issues with spacing and it isnâ€™t easily organized. It also uses some old css techniques that could be improved and it doesn't look right in narrow devices.

We would also like to add our brand somewhere (maybe a `Powered by OmbuLabs` label? you can find some images at `/images`).

Get creative, how would you change this page to be more easily understood and interacted with? 

## Notes

* Don't worry about the screens where the buttons would take you, this is just a mock of the real website only created for this test and the buttons are disabled

* This is intended to be a ~4hs project

* You can change anything from the provided css in `css/custom.css` and also the `index.html` if you need to (re-arrange/add tags, add classes, remove things, everything is allowed).

## Some resources

* We are using our own base styleguide for some colors, fonts, guidelines, etc. It's already included in the header. You can check it [here](http://ombulabs.github.io/styleguide/) if you want to check some of the styles being used.

* The head tag also includes FontAwesome library if you want to add some icons.

* At `/images` you have some images if you need to use them for something.

## How to submit the challenge

Fork this repository, add the changes to your fork and send us the link.

> If you use any special setup to build the project (like adding sass/less or other tools to compile JS for example), please include the instructions to run your code in a local environment for us to be able to test it properly

### Finally

Feel free to email us with any questions, happy designing!
